/// <c>ASPNETCORE_HOSTINGSTARTUPASSEMBLIES</c>. It routes to the profiler that matches the application's
/// telemetry stack without any code change in the target application.
///
/// This router is deliberately <b>stack-agnostic</b>: it has no compile-time reference to either profiler
/// stack. It reflectively invokes a per-stack <em>activator</em> (via
/// <see cref="IProfilerActivatorInvoker"/>) that lives in its own payload subfolder with its own dependency
/// closure. Combined with the <c>StartupHook</c> scoping the assembly resolver to just the detected stack's
/// subfolder, this keeps the two stacks' dependencies fully isolated from each other.
///
/// Activation is fail-safe: every failure - during detection, during the deferred
/// <see cref="IWebHostBuilder.ConfigureServices"/> callback that registers the profiler (e.g. a
/// <c>MissingMethodException</c>/<c>FileNotFoundException</c> from an incompatible dependency version the
/// application brought), or later - is caught and logged so the host always starts. The profiler simply
/// disables itself; it never takes down the application.
